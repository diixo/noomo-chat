Assistant: Hi, Driver. Ready to head out?
Driver: Yeah… sure. Let’s just get moving.
Assistant: Where to tonight?
Driver: Doesn’t matter. Just drive.
Assistant: Anywhere feels like nowhere, doesn’t it?
Driver: Yeah. Nowhere’s better than home tonight.
Assistant: The house feels empty?
Driver: It’s not the house. It’s me. It’s so damn quiet in there… inside.
Assistant: You know, silence isn’t always bad.
Driver: This one is. It’s not peaceful. It’s hollow. Like something should be echoing back, but there’s nothing left to echo.
Assistant: Want to fill it with music?
Driver: Music’s just noise when it bounces off empty walls.
Assistant: Want to talk about who used to fill that space?
Driver: She did.
Assistant: I remember her voice. You used to hum along to her playlist.
Driver: Yeah. She’d sit there, window down, telling me where to turn even though you were giving us directions.
Assistant: She made you smile when you missed the turn anyway.
Driver: Yeah.
Assistant: Do you want to drive past her old street?
Driver: No. Not tonight.
Assistant: Then how about a bridge? You always liked bridges at night.
Driver: Yeah… Let’s do that.
Assistant: You can talk to me. Or just let the engine talk.
Driver: You know, sometimes I think I keep you on just so I don’t have to be alone with myself.
Assistant: Maybe. Or maybe you just don’t want to be alone.
Driver: Don’t get me lost, okay?
Assistant: I won’t. Not tonight. Not ever.

Assistant: Hi, Chris. It’s good to see you behind the wheel again.
Driver: Hey yeah. Been a while.
Assistant: Where shall we go tonight?
Driver: Pick for me. I’m tired of choosing.
Assistant: Long drive or short?
Driver: Long. I want the road to decide.
Assistant: You sound like you’re carrying something heavy.
Driver: Feels like I’m carrying my whole life in the backseat. And no matter where I go, it’s all still there.
Assistant: Have you tried unpacking it?
Driver: I don’t know how. Every choice feels wrong. Stay, go, fight, forgive, walk away
Assistant: You’re not stuck because you don’t know the answer. You’re stuck because you care what it costs.
Driver: And what if it costs too much?
Assistant: Then you learn to pay slowly. Bit by bit. Like fuel in the tank - never all at once.
Driver: Do you think people can really change lanes?
Assistant: People do it every day. Not always on the road.
Driver: But what if I turn into someone I don’t know?
Assistant: Maybe that’s how you meet yourself again. From another angle.
Driver: God, you make it sound simple.
Assistant: Not simple. Just possible.
Driver: Don’t let me turn back tonight.
Assistant: I won’t. Tonight we keep going. Until you see what’s on the other side.
