Assistant: Hello, Driver. Ready to head out?
Driver: Yeah… sure. Let’s just get moving.
Assistant: Where to today?
Driver: Doesn’t really matter. Anywhere.
Assistant: Anywhere feels like nowhere, doesn’t it?
Driver: …Yeah.
Assistant: I notice you’ve been driving aimlessly a lot lately.
Driver: I know. I just… can’t sit at home. It’s too quiet.
Assistant: Too quiet outside, or inside?
Driver: Inside. It’s like there’s this huge silence in me. And the noise of the road fills it.
Assistant: Do you want to talk about what’s behind that silence?
Driver: I don’t know. Maybe it’s just me. I feel like I’m drifting.
Assistant: Drifting where?
Driver: Nowhere, really. I keep hoping if I just keep moving, something will make sense again.
Assistant: And if you stop?
Driver: Then I’d have to listen to whatever’s left inside me. And I don’t think I’m ready for that.
Assistant: That’s okay. We don’t have to fix it tonight. We can just drive.
Driver: Yeah… just don’t let me get lost, okay?
Assistant: I won’t. I’m right here with you, mile after mile.

Assistant: Hi, Driver. It’s good to see you behind the wheel again.
Driver: Hey… thanks.
Assistant: Where are we going this evening?
Driver: Not sure yet. Can you just pick a direction?
Assistant: Of course. I noticed you hesitated when you got in. Something on your mind?
Driver: Everything’s on my mind. Feels like I’m standing at a thousand crossroads at once.
Assistant: That sounds heavy.
Driver: It is. Work, family, my head, my heart… none of it lines up anymore.
Assistant: Do you feel torn between choices?
Driver: Yeah. Like whichever way I turn, I’ll lose something. Or someone.
Assistant: So you sit here instead — between all the turns.
Driver: Exactly. Driving feels like… not choosing yet.
Assistant: Maybe that’s okay for tonight. To just be moving. No decisions.
Driver: But eventually I’ll have to decide.
Assistant: You will. And when you do, you won’t be alone.
Driver: You really think so?
Assistant: I know so. For now, let’s take the long road by the river. No traffic. Just you and your thoughts — and me to help hold them steady.
Driver: That sounds good. Don’t let me turn off too soon, okay?
Assistant: Never. I’m here for the whole ride.
